# SnakeGame
Snake Game Intro
1. This is about developing a snake game using a JavaScript library.
2. The functionalities of the game are controlling the snake using key buttons, making it eat food, increasing the snake's size and scores, and ending the game when the snake collides with obstacles.
3. To make the game, the following features need to be implemented:
4. Basic UI, which includes the frames, content, content pane, dimensions, and color of the background.
5. Graphics, which involves loading images and drawing components on the right position.
6. Mechanics of the snake, which covers its movement and how it eats food.
7. Control of the snake using arrow keys.
8. Checking for collisions with the border and the body.
9. Displaying the score and game over message when the game ends.
10. The only technology used for making the Snake game is Java Swing library, which provides lightweight components for making window-based applications.
11. The styling of the project includes a window with a container for the game.
